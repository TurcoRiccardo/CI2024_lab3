## N-Puzzle problem
The n puzzle is a classical problem for modeling algorithms involving heuristics. Commonly used heuristics for this problem include counting the number of misplaced tiles and finding the sum of the taxicab distances between each block and its position in the goal configuration. Note that both are admissible.

## Depth-First approach
Memory consumption is high, we can't always find a solution if the number of iterations is too low.
- 8-puzzle: it takes too much time (> 15m)
- 15-puzzle: it takes too much time

## Breadth-First approach
Memory consumption is a little lower than the depth-first approach but still too high, we can't always find a solution if the number of iterations is too low.
- 8-puzzle: it takes too much time (> 15m)
- 15-puzzle: it takes too much time

## A*
For the Puzzle with low N we can find a solution with a low number of iterations, we can't always find a solution with higher dimensional problems.
- Using Hamming Distance as a cost function:
    - 8-puzzle: time = 7m 9s, quality = 22
    - 15-puzzle: it takes too much time
- Using Manhattan Distance as a cost function:
    - 8-puzzle: time = 2.8s, quality = 22
    - 15-puzzle: it takes too much time
- Using Manhattan Distance + LinearConflict as a cost function:
    - 8-puzzle: time = 1.4s, quality = 22
    - 15-puzzle: it takes too much time

## IDA*
For the Puzzle with low N we can find a solution with a low number of iterations, we can't always find a solution with higher dimensional problems.
- Using manhattan_distance as a cost function.
    - 8-puzzle: time = 0.1s, quality = 22
    - 15-puzzle: time = 1m 2.4s, quality = 36
    - 24-puzzle: time = 3m 21.1s, quality = 46
    - 35-puzzle: it takes too much time
- Using Manhattan Distance + LinearConflict as a cost function:
    - 8-puzzle: time = 0.1s, quality = 22
    - 15-puzzle: time = 11.8s, quality = 36
    - 24-puzzle: time = 56.3s, quality = 46
    - 35-puzzle: time = 53m 22.6s, quality = 56
