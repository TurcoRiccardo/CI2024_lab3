## N-Puzzle problem
The n puzzle is a classical problem for modeling algorithms involving heuristics. Commonly used heuristics for this problem include counting the number of misplaced tiles and finding the sum of the taxicab distances between each block and its position in the goal configuration. Note that both are admissible.

### Initial input for the problem:
The initial state of the N-puzzle problems are completely random, generated by 100_000 random action on the expected output puzzle

### Expected output for the 8-Puzzle problem:
|1|2|3|
|:---:|:---:|:---:| 
|4|5|6|
|7|8|0|

### Expected output for the 15-Puzzle problem:
|1|2|3|4|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:| 
|5|6|7|8|
|9|10|11|12|
|13|14|15|0|

## Depth-First approach
Memory consumption is high, we can't always find a solution if the number of iterations is too low.
- 8-puzzle: it takes too much time (> 15m)
- 15-puzzle: it takes too much time

## Breadth-First approach
Memory consumption is a little lower than the depth-first approach but still too high, we can't always find a solution if the number of iterations is too low.
- 8-puzzle: it takes too much time (> 15m)
- 15-puzzle: it takes too much time

## A*
For the Puzzle with low N we can find a solution with a low number of iterations, we can't always find a solution with higher dimensional problems.
This version of A* use manhattan_distance as a cost function.
- 8-puzzle: time = 22s, quality = 24, efficiency = 0.363
- 15-puzzle: time = 1m 12s, quality = 24, efficiency = 0.125
- 24-puzzle: it takes too much time
